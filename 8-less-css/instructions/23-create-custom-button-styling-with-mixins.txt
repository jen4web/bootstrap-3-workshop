For the 4 buttons on the home page, let's make these all look the same!

There are several ways of doing this, but let's work with mixins to see how we can create a new button style.

1. Create a new color declaration in variables.less, around line 22

//Jen's new color
@brand-love:            #ca448c;



2. Open mixins/buttons.less -- scroll to line 6, see the button mixin.

Open buttons.less -- scroll to line 66 to see the various types of buttons using the button mixin. 


3. In buttons.less, scroll down to around line 88, insert code:

// Love appears as pink, a custom Jen color
.btn-love {
  .button-variant(#fff; @brand-love; darken(@brand-love, 20%));
}

(Could establish variables for each one of these colors, but since we're using them once, I did not do that step.)


4. In the HTML, change the classes in the links on lines 57, 63, 69, 75 to something like:

<a href="apples.html" class="btn btn-love">


5. Save all HTML and LESS files, compile bootstrap.less, look at website!
