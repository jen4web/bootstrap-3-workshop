http://getbootstrap.com/customize/

Allows the following customization:

"LESS files"

Should Bootstrap include styling for the following elements? Not including the styling eliminates this, making bootstrap(.min).css smaller.


"jQuery Plugins"

Should Bootstrap include the JS required for the following plugins? Not including the code makes bootstrap(.min).js smaller.


"LESS variables"

Customize the variables that come with Bootstrap via this interface. Does the same thing as working with variables.less. Take note of what you change in case you need to download a new copy of Bootstrap later. In some cases, this can output a .json file so it does remember what was downloaded for you.
