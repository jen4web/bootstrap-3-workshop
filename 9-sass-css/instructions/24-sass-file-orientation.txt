Jen will go into the less folder and talk about the files contained there.

She will talk about:

_bootstrap.sass: the only file that gets compiled, links to all other partial files

bootstrap/_variables.sass: where centralized variables are stored

bootstrap/_jumbotron.sass: an example of a typical Sass file, in this case controlling the look of the jumbotron.

To understand the Sass, we move back and forth between _variables.sass (to get the values) and _jumbotron.sass to figure out what the style will be. Check bootstrap.min.css to get the final value of the jumbotron style.

Variables start with $ sign

A variable can equal a value (#123456, 3em, 5px, "../fonts/", etc)

Or another variable ($jumbotron-bg: $brand-success)

Or a function.

Example of function:

$gray-darker:            lighten(#000, 13.5%); // #222
